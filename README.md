## shell

This repo defines my personal shell configurations.

Running `setup.sh` will install oh-my-zsh, link in my dotfiles, install zsh plugins and the zsh honukai theme, link my tmux configuration, and install atom packages if desired.

To install `git clone https://github.com/slantin/shell.git ~/.shell; cd ~/.shell; ./setup.sh`.
