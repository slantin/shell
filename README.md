#shell

This repo defines my personal shell configurations. 

It is (will be) set up so that when I get a new computer, or EC2, or whatever, I can run `./setup.sh` and quickly:
* link in my `.profile`, `.zshrc`, etc
* add plugins and themes not included by default in `oh-my-zsh`
* and some other stuff...?
